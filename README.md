# üì± Nextap

Nextap is an innovative wallet system that leverages NFC (Near Field Communication) and QR codes to simplify digital transactions, enabling users to create wallets, log in, and approve transactions seamlessly. By integrating blockchain technology, Nextap addresses common issues found in traditional wallet systems, offering a secure, user-friendly, and decentralized payment experience.

# üöÄ Introduction

Nextap is designed to streamline digital payments by using NFC cards for wallet creation and login, and QR codes for transaction generation and approval. Unlike existing wallets that require app installations, hardware purchases, or custodial trust, Nextap offers a decentralized, low-cost solution by utilizing everyday NFC cards and QR codes.

# ‚ùó Problem Statement

The existing digital wallet solutions come with several limitations:
-	‚Ä¢	Custodial Wallets: Reliance on trusted entities, which can lead to security and privacy concerns.
-	‚Ä¢	Mobile Wallets: Require users to download and set up apps, which can be cumbersome.
-	‚Ä¢	Hardware Wallets: High cost and limited token support make them less accessible.

To overcome these challenges, we developed Nextap, allowing users to use their existing NFC-enabled credit/debit cards for wallet creation and login, while facilitating transactions through QR codes, without the need for additional apps or hardware.

# ‚ú® Key Features

-	‚Ä¢	NFC Card Wallet Creation: Use any NFC-enabled card to create and log in to your wallet effortlessly.
-	‚Ä¢	QR Code-Based Transactions: Generate and approve transactions using QR codes, reducing manual effort.
-	‚Ä¢	Blockchain Integration: Decentralized and secure storage of transaction data on the blockchain.
-	‚Ä¢	Offline Payment Support: Seamless offline payments using NFC cards, ideal for in-store and event purchases.
-	‚Ä¢	EIP-681 Support: Simplified transaction requests encoded into QR codes.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. NFC Card Wallet Creation

	‚Ä¢	Step 1: Tap your NFC-enabled card on your device.
	‚Ä¢	Step 2: The NFC Web API captures the card UID and creates a wallet address.
	‚Ä¢	Step 3: Wallet address is linked to the user on the blockchain.
	‚Ä¢	Step 4: The user can log in using the same NFC card.

2. QR Code Transaction Generation & Approval

	‚Ä¢	Step 1: The user initiates a payment, and a QR code is generated using EIP-681.
	‚Ä¢	Step 2: The QR code is stored in a decentralized Tableland database.
	‚Ä¢	Step 3: The recipient scans the QR code, retrieves transaction details, and approves the transaction.
	‚Ä¢	Step 4: Blockchain validates and completes the transaction.

# ‚úÖ Advantages

-	‚Ä¢	No App Installation Required: Create wallets and conduct transactions using NFC cards and QR codes without installing any apps.
-	‚Ä¢	Increased Security: Decentralized storage and blockchain integration ensure high security and privacy.
